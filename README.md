# MLP-Numpy
A simple modular implementation of Multi Layer Perceptron in pure Numpy. I used the Iris dataset from scikit-learn library for the experiments.

## Features
 - Fully modular and configurable
 - Different learning rates can be used for different layers and iterations. (Dynamic learning rate)
 - Pure numpy with no additional dependecies
 - Supports Linear, Softmax, Sigmoid, TanH, and ReLU activations
